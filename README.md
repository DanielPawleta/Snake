# Snake
SnakeV1
This is my project created to get some knowledge and experience using Swing to create GUI, my version of this popular game includes:

pausing and resuming the game, 

saving and loading game to file, 

saving best scores to file,

choosing prefered game field size. 

In the future I would like to add some more functionality like choosing prefered color-style for game obects, add possibility to add obstacles on game filed or implement turbo-mode while holding space-key
